On Saturday 27 March there will be special preview screening of a film produced for the National Geographic Channel about the Staffordshire Hoard entitled 'Saxon Gold - Finding the Hoard'.

This will be followed with an informal question and answer session with museum staff who have been closely involved with the Hoard. This will be the public's chance to ask questions that may arise from the documentary
or from their interest in the Hoard.

The screening will take place at 2pm in the AV room at Birmingham Museum
and Art Gallery. This is a special fundraising event for the Hoard appeal. All profits will go to the Hoard Acquisition Fund. The cost of tickets will be Â£10.

To book a place at the event telephone 0121 303 1966. The Staffordshire Hoard is on display in Gallery 20 at the museum.
