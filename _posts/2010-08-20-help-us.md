A big thank you to everyone who has helped save the Staffordshire Hoard for the Nation – together we raised the £3.3 million needed to secure the treasure for generations to come.

We are so proud and privileged to be its custodian and we must now look after it properly. We need to raise a further £2.3 million to conserve and research of the Hoard, so that its secrets can be unlocked and the treasure can be displayed for all to see. From detailed gold analysis, to in-depth analysis on the garnets, to understand more about the eastern trading links that existed in Anglo-Saxon times. We are also working to create a new Mercian Trail that will see the Hoard displayed across the region.

Without your help, we might have lost the Hoard.

We now need your continued support so that we and generations to come, can understand and learn from the stories the Hoard will tell us.

The City of Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery Development Trust (registered charity number 701785) and the Friends of the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery (registered charity number 507834) are both raising money to conserve, research and display the hoard across the region.
