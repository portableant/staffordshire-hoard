The announcement of the discovery on 23 September astonished experts and made headlines around the world, with people queuing for up to three hours to see the hoard in Birmingham Museum when it first went on display. A temporary display of some objects from the hoard is due to open in the British Museum on 3 November. Dr Kevin Leahy, National Adviser for the Portable Antiquities Scheme, is the expert who has been studying the hoard, and in this lecture he talks about what the hoard is, what can be said about it at the moment, and what further work needs to be done.<br />

#### Thursday 10 December, 18.30 - The Staffordshire Hoard: the story of the discovery [BP Lecture Theatre]

The Staffordshire Hoard was discovered in July 2009, and is a unique find containing over 1,500 gold and silver objects. The announcement of the discovery on 23 September astonished experts and made headlines around the world, with people queuing for up to three hours to see the hoard in Birmingham Museum when it first went on display. A temporary display of some objects from the hoard is due to open in the British Museum on 3 November. Roger Bland, Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum, has been involved with the Staffordshire Hoard since it was found by metal-detector user Terry Herbert. In this lecture, he tells the story of how it was found, the work that has been carried out on the hoard so far, and what will happen to it next. At the moment, this fascinating story is just beginning and there is still a great deal more work to be done before all the secrets of this unique find are unlocked.
