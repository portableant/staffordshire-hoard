The Staffordshire Hoard (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_hoard"
title="Article on wikipedia about the hoard">wikipedia article</a>)
is an unparalleled treasure find dating from Anglo-Saxon times. Both the quality
and quantity of this unique treasure are remarkable. The story of how it came to be
left in the Staffordshire soil is likely to be more remarkable still.

The Hoard was first discovered in July 2009. The find is likely to spark decades
of debate among archaeologists, historians and enthusiasts.

Leslie Webster, Former Keeper, Department of Prehistory and Europe, British Museum,
has already said:

> This is going to alter our perceptions of Anglo-Saxon England… as
radically, if not more so, as the Sutton Hoo discoveries.
Absolutely the equivalent of finding a new Lindisfarne Gospels or Book
of Kells.

### The Hoard

The Hoard comprises in excess 1,500 individual items. Most are gold, although
some are silver. Many are decorated with precious stones. The quality of the
craftsmanship displayed on many items is supreme, indicating possible royal
ownership.

Stylistically most items appear to date from the seventh century, although there
is already debate among experts about when the Hoard first entered the ground.

This was a period of great turmoil. England did not yet exist. A number of kingdoms
with tribal loyalties vied with each other in a state of semi-perpetual warfare,
 with the balance of power constantly ebbing and flowing.

England was also split along religious lines. Christianity, introduced during the
Roman occupation then driven to near extinction, was once again the principal
religion across most of England

The exact spot where the Hoard lay hidden for a millennium and a half cannot yet
be revealed. However we can say that it lay at the heart of the Anglo-Saxon
Kingdom of Mercia. There is approximately 5 kg of gold and 1.3 kg of silver
(Sutton Hoo had 1.66kg of gold).

The hoard was reported to Duncan Slarke, Finds Liaison Officer with the Portable
Antiquities Scheme. With the assistance of the finder, the find-spot has been excavated
by archaeologists from Staffordshire County Council, lead by Ian Wykes and Steven Dean,
and a team from Birmingham Archaeology, project managed by Bob Burrows and funded
by English Heritage. The hoard has been examined at Birmingham Museum and Art
Gallery by Dr Kevin Leahy, National Finds Adviser with the Portable Antiquities
Scheme.

The Coroner for South Staffordshire, Andrew Haigh, is today (24th September 2009)
holding an inquest on the find to decide whether it is treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.
If it is declared treasure, the find becomes the property of the Crown, and museums
will have the opportunity to acquire it after it has been valued by the Treasure
Valuation Committee. The Committee’s remit is to value all treasure finds at their
full market value and the finder and landowner will divide the reward between them.
Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent,
and Staffordshire County Council wish to preserve the find for the West Midlands.

#### Sword hilt fittings

The Hoard is remarkable for the extraordinary quantity of pommel caps and hilt plates.
There have been 84 pommel caps and 71 sword hilt collars so far identified. These
highly decorated items would have adorned a sword or seax – a short sword/knife.
Most are of gold and many are beautifully inlaid with garnets. Such elaborate and
expensive decoration would have marked out the weapon as the property of the highest
echelons of nobility. The discovery of a single sword fitting is a notable event:
to find so many together is absolutely unprecedented.

#### Helmets

Parts from several highly decorated helmets are likely to be among the finds,
although piecing these together is likely to take considerable time and effort.
Among the most conspicuous is what appears to be a magnificently decorated cheek-piece
decorated with a frieze of running, interlaced, animals. Interestingly, this piece
has a relatively low gold content. This may be the result of being specially alloyed
to make it more functional and able to withstand blows.

A beautiful figure of an animal is also possibly the crest of a helmet. Large
numbers of fragments of "C" sectioned silver edging and reeded strips could also
be helmet fittings. Similar fragments, made from base metal, formed part of the
Sutton Hoo helmet, found in a rich grave in Suffolk, in 1939.

#### Biblical inscription

A strip of gold bearing a Biblical inscription in Latin is one of the most significant
and controversial finds. Michelle Brown, Professor of Medieval Manuscript Studies,
has suggested the style of lettering dates from the seventh or early eighth centuries.
The relatively crude lettering may have been the work of someone more used to writing
on wax tablets.

The suitably warlike inscription, mis-spelt in places, is probably from the Book of Numbers
 Ch. 10 v 35 and reads:

Surge domine et dissipentur inimici tui et fugiant qui oderunt te a facie tua  ~ "Rise up, o Lord, and may thy enemies be dispersed and those who hate thee be driven from thy face"

#### The folded cross

The only items that are clearly non-martial are two, or possibly three, crosses.
The largest may have been an altar or processional cross. Other than the loss of
the settings used to decorate it (some of which are present but detached) it is intact.
However it has been folded, possibly to make it fit into a small space prior to burial.
This lack of apparent respect shown to this Christian symbol may point to the Hoard
being buried by pagans, but Christians were also quite capable of despoiling each
other’s shrines.
