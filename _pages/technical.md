This site was built in one day by Daniel Pett, PAS ICT Adviser, using the OpenSource
Textpattern Content Management System which is freely available from <a href="http://www.textpattern.com" title="Textpattern's website">www.textpattern.com</a>.

The labeling of images was conducted by Katharine Kelland over a period of a few days.
The data was manipulated from original work by Kevin Leahy via Roger Bland. The
fantastic images come from a variety of sources - Daniel Buxton and David Rowan
(Birmingham University), the councils involved and Duncan Slarke (the local FLO).

The technology employed is enhanced by a variety of plugins which leverages
different content providers. A content delivery network has been used for
delivering the <a href="http://www.jquery.com" title="The jQuery framework">jQuery javascript framework</a>,
and images are hosted on <a href="http://www.flickr.com" title="The flickr website">Flickr's site</a>.

* Flickr's api - using a customised and extended version of the VDH_flickr plugin, in combination with Lightbox2
* YQL and Twitter in conjunction with the simplepie extension to see what people have been saying about the hoard in realtime
* YQL to pull in online news articles for the hoard
* Youtube/vimeo to find video footage of news stories - these will appear when they become available

Textpattern is gaining a following in the Heritage sector with LP Archaeology producing a
number of their sites on the platform.

Several examples are:

* <a href="http://www.pef.org.uk" title="The Palestine Exploration Fund's website">Palestine Exploration Fund</a>
* <a href="http://www.thamesdiscovery.org" title="The Thames Discovery Project website">Thames Discovery Project</a>
