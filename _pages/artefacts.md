The hoard contains in excess of 1500 objects made from various metals - 5kg of gold
and 1.3kg of silver - by contrast the Sutton Hoo find contained 1.66kg of precious metals.
The documents below provide a catalogue of the objects contained within and a report
on their discovery, initial and subsequent interpretation. You are also able to
browse through the images of the objects, which are pulled directly from our flickr
account. Once the catalogue is finished and recorded on the Portable Antiquities
Scheme's database, the information will be brought into this site as a searchable
index.

## The Staffordshire Hoard

659 Photos

This hoard is perhaps the most important collection of Anglo-Saxon objects found in England.
It compares and perhaps exceeds those objects found at Sutton Hoo. Originally discovered by
metal detectorist Terry Herbert in July 2009 and subsequently excavated by Birmingham
University Archaeology Unit and Staffordshire County Council.

Leslie Webster, former Keeper of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum describes
this discovery as:

> "...this is going to alter our perceptions of Anglo-Saxon England in the seventh and early
eighth century as radically, if not more so, as the 1939 Sutton Hoo discoveries did;
it will make historians and literary scholars review what their sources tell us,
and archaeologists and art-historians rethink the chronology of metalwork and manuscripts;
and it will make us all think again about rising (and failing) kingdoms and the
expression of regional identities in this period, the complicated transition from
paganism to Christianity, the conduct of battle and the nature of fine
metalwork production - to name only a few of the many huge issues it raises.
Absolutely the metalwork equivalent of finding a new Lindisfarne Gospels or
Book of Kells."
