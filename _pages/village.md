The above exercise was designed in 2004 by the Portable Antiquities Scheme's Central Unit,
with design by the British Museum's Educational Multimedia Unit. It is aimed at Key Stage 3.
You can find out more about the context of this exercise from the lesson plans on the PASt
explorers website. It demonstrates the two key groups who contribute to the Scheme's work:
metal detecting and field walking. It was aimed to include archaeological fieldwork,
but was too difficult to include on a rather limited budget.
