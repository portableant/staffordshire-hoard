### Staffordshire County Council

The county council is responsible for protecting the physical remains of Staffordshire’s
past whether this is archaeological sites, monuments, historic buildings or even
whole historic landscapes. Under the Treasure Act the find was reported to the
county council and officers have since been responsible for the excavation and
recording of the find.

Philip Atkins, Leader of the county council said:

> We will ensure the Hoard, and the fascinating story that lies behind it becomes
as accessible to the public as possible. This is Staffordshire’s heritage and we
will do it justice.

### Birmingham City Council

Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery (BMAG) has provided secure storage for the
items and workspace for the specialist 'finds adviser' to carry out initial
cataloguing work and analysis, including X-ray and XRF (X-ray fluorescence) scans.

BMAG is responsible for managing three Finds Liaison Officers, for the region and
the Staffordshire Hoard was initially reported to Duncan Slarke, Finds Liaison Officer
for Staffordshire and the West Midlands, based at the museum.

Councillor Mike Whitby, Leader of Birmingham City Council, said:

> We are absolutely delighted to be playing a significant part in this remarkable
and historic find. I am particularly proud to say that the first artefacts will
go on public display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

### Stoke-on-Trent City Council

Stoke-on-Trent City Council runs the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery and is collecting
authority for archaeological finds for the area where the Hoard was discovered.

Leader Ross Irving said:

> We are thrilled that this treasure has been unearthed in the county. We will be working
very closely with neighbouring authorities to secure these incomparible artefacts
for the region's economy and heritage.

### English Heritage

English Heritage immediately recognised the exceptional nature of the finds and provided
£25K of emergency funds and specialist advice to Staffordshire County Council to assist
in the vital task of retrieving the precious archaeology and preserving its context.

### Portable Antiquities Scheme

The Portable Antiquities Scheme records archaeological finds found by members of
the public and publishes them on its online database,[www.finds.org.uk](http://www.finds.org.uk "The Scheme's website").
There is a network of Finds Liaison Officers based in museums and county councils
around England and Wales and six National Finds Advisers and other staff based
at the British Museum. The project is managed by the British Museum on behalf
of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.

### The British Museum

The British Museum has a statutory role in the administration of the Treasure Act
on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Staff provide advice on
finds to the coroner and provide the secretariat of the Treasure Valuation Committee.

The Treasure Valuation Committee advises the Secretary of State on the valuation of
finds of Treasure that museums wish to acquire.

### University of Birmingham

Birmingham Archaeology (part of the University of Birmingham) were initially invited
by Staffordshire County Council to provide assistance with the excavation. Based
on the quantity and distribution of finds recovered from the test-pit it was decided by
Staffordshire County Council in consultation with English Heritage and the Portable
Antiquities Scheme to extend the area for investigation. Birmingham Archaeology
also undertook a rapid geophysical survey of the whole field. Outside the area
for hand excavation Birmingham Archaeology provided assistance with
metal detector surveys which aimed to recover any objects
associated with the Hoard.
