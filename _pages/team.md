### Terry Herbert: The finder

Terry is a metal detectorist who initially discovered the Hoard. Terry was detecting
on private farmland with the written consent of the landowner. After uncovering an
initial number of items Terry informed the [Portable Antiquities Scheme](http://www.finds.org.uk/ "Find out about the Scheme"),
as required by the Treasure Act 1996. Terry remained an integral part of the team
working on recovering the Hoard – an excellent example of archaeologists and
detectorists working together.

An interview with Terry, along with the photographs, is being syndicated by the
Press Association today. Terry does not plan to give any further interviews.

### Ian Wykes: Staffordshire County Council

Ian leads the county council’s Historic Environment Team, and is an archaeologist by
profession.

He said:

>Being in charge, along with Stephen, of the excavation of such an important find
is a huge responsibility. I think for any archaeologist this is the find of a lifetime
and reaffirms why you became an archaeologist in the first place. It was only when
I saw the treasure still in the ground that it started to sink in. To be the first
person to see an object since it was buried almost 1500 years ago, and exactly as
they would have last seen it, is a real privilege.

### Steve Dean, Staffordshire County Council

Stephen is Staffordshire’s County Archaeologist. Since 1994 Stephen has worked as
a field archaeologist and as an archaeological consultant and joined Staffordshire
County Council in 2004.

Steve said:

> To be involved in such an important find as the Staffordshire Hoard is a once in
a lifetime opportunity for any archaeologist.  As such I deem myself incredibly
fortunate to have been working for Staffordshire County Council and had the
opportunity to become involved when this incredible find was made.

### Dr. Roger Bland OBE, British Museum/Portable Antiquities Scheme

Roger Bland is Head of the Department of Portable Antiquities & Treasure at the
British Museum and leads the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Roger was seconded to
the DCMS from 1994 to 2003 to advise on the Treasure Act and PAS and other cultural
property issues and before that served as Curator of Roman Coins in the Department
of Coins and Medals for some twenty years. Roger said:

> I would like to pay tribute to Terry Herbert and to the landowner for promptly
reporting the find and for giving every assistance to the archaeological investigation
of the site. I see this find as the clearest possible demonstration of why the
 Treasure Act and the Portable Antiquities Scheme have such a crucial role in
 protecting our heritage for everyone’s benefit.

### Duncan Slarke, Portable Antiquities Scheme</h3>

Duncan Slarke is the scheme’s Finds Liaison Officer for Staffordshire, based
in Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery and the Potteries Museum. He was the first
professional to see the Hoard:

> Nothing could have prepared me for that. I saw boxes full of gold, items exhibiting
the very finest Anglo-Saxon workmanship.  It was breathtaking.  My role was to report
the hoard to the coroner as potential treasure and to take receipt of the finds as
they were made. I worked very closely with the finder and landowner throughout
the process.  Their assistance was immense.  I feel very privileged to have been
the FLO that dealt with Staffordshire Hoard.

### Dr Kevin Leahy: Portable Antiquities Scheme

Kevin came from Burton on Trent and this find brings him back to where he started.
Trained as a foundry engineer before going into archaeology, he is interested in
metalworking and has written a book on Anglo-Saxon crafts. He has excavated major
Anglo-Saxon sites, including the Cleatham cremation cemetery.

He said:

> After all those urns I think deserve the Staffordshire find.”

He is a National Advisor for the Portable Antiquities Scheme with responsibity
for early medieval metalwork.

### Deb Klemperer, Stoke-on-Trent City Council

Local history collections officer Deb Klemperer is a specialist in Saxo-Norman
Staffordshire pottery. She said:

> I have been involved in archaeology for 34 years, the last 20 at the Potteries
Museum and Art Gallery - one of the largest local authority museums.
My first view of the hoard brought tears to my eyes - the Dark Ages in Staffordshire have never
looked so bright nor so beautiful. This incredible find will sit alongside numerous collections
of archaeological remains which are interpreted within the context of the geological,
natural and social history of our area.

### Bill Klemperer, English Heritage

Bill Klemperer is an Inspector of Ancient Monuments from the Birmingham English Heritage
office. Bill formerly worked at Stoke-on-Trent Museum before a spell with Staffordshire's
County Council.

He said:

>When I was asked to walk the few hundred metres from my office to Birmingham Museum
 to see some amazing finds the exquisite cratfsmanship and quality of the artefacts
 made it clear this was a find of real importance for the nation. Over the next couple
 of days the team built up and I worked with colleagues in the Portable Antiquities
 Scheme and Staffordshire County Council to agree the best approach and manage the dig.

We will learn more about this mysterious period when England was divided into sometimes
warring nations.This is what English Heritage exists to achieve.
